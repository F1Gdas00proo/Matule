**The development was done using the latest stable version of Flutter at the time of the project.
This project is a championship app template that uses the Mobx state management method in Flutter. It includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users and authentication, making it a realistic example for real-world scenarios. To demonstrate that native apps can be created using Flutter, the project's user interface used components that are as close to native as possible instead of standard Flutter components.
